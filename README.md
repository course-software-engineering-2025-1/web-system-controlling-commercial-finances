# FinanTrack 
This repository contains the final project for the Software Engineering course undertaken in the first semester of 2025. 

## System Overview
The idea for this project was born from a real need, observed in the day-to-day running of a family business. We realized the difficulty in organizing finances efficiently without a practical and accessible tool. The motivation is, therefore, to create a solution that solves this challenge, offering complete and intuitive financial control.
